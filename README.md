# Prism-P.I.
## A unique learn-to-code app



### What needs to be finished before Oct 30:

- [ ] Tester can run test against json
- [ ] Need at least 3 levels, with json declaring them.
- [ ] Block code working and finished
  - [ ] Put in the GUI, can move and manipulate
  - [ ] Needs to register type, as the lang is strongly typed
  - [ ] Function to convert into text
- [ ] Much cooler looking gui
- [ ] Showing Mediated Transfer



#### Block code

There needs to be distinct blocks that can be used and manipulated.
Declaration:
<type> *name* <- **expression**
Assignment:    
<var> <- **expression**    
Expression (Mostly for void function calls)
Although, we might not need void function calls:
**expression**
If Statement:
If **expression**    
    )    
Else    
    )    
)    
While Statement:
While **expression**
    )
)
You get the gist of it all. its complex.
But there also has to be tinier blocks for expressions.
Like adding, subtracting, comparing, etc.
